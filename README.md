======================

![Title](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/TaskBoard/master/screenshots/title-screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Task Board app provides you with a way to view and update tasks during your daily standup meeting. [Here](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html) is an explaination from Martin Fowler about what makes up for a productive standup meeting.

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/TaskBoard/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

You can:

* View tasks in rows next to their associated user stories
* Use drag & drop controls to quickly change the state of a task
* Edit the Estimate, To Do, Owner, and State fields without leaving the board
* Delete tasks
* View blocked tasks
* Filter content by owner, accepted state

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). Since this app uses a very old version of Rally's SDK, the app is only presented in its deployed form.

## License

TaskBoard is released under the MIT license.  See the file [LICENSE](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/TaskBoard/master/LICENSE) for the full text.
